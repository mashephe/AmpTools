AmpTools is library to facilitate performing unbinned maximum likelihood
fits of experimental data to a coherent sum of amplitudes.  Additional
information can be found here:

https://github.com/mashephe/AmpTools/wiki

Three modules are included with the distribution and individual README files,
are contained within each module.

AmpTools:  This is the main AmpTools library.  Once compiled it includes
no executable code, but provides functionality and an interface that the
user can utilize to perform analyses.

Tutorials:  This contains a couple of examples of how to utilize the AmpTools
library.  We try to keep these up to date as AmpTools develops.  It is
recommended that user explore the Dalitz tutorial.

AmpPlotter:  This is an optional package that provides a GUI interface
for viewing the projections of a fit.  It enables visualization of the
contributions of various amplitudes to the fit.
