Dalitz
------

Author:  Ryan Mitchell (remitche@indiana.edu)

A simple example of a Dalitz plot analysis.  It illustrates generating MC and a toy
data set for fitting.  This example can also be compiled to use MPI and GPU acceleration.


RELEASE NOTES:

v0.12 (28-Jun-21):

A new structure for MPI-based fitting is reflected in the fitAmplitudes
executable.  This allows multiple subsequent fits to be run in a single
executable, e.g., when fitting with randomized fit parameters.

v0.11 (19-Jan-21):

Removed gammaKK tutorial because it has not been maintained
and checked for functionality.

Include copyDalitz.py script to copy the Dalitz tutorial to create
a template that can be edited for a new analysis.

v0.10 (10-Jun-19):

Add ability to precalculate user variables to BreitWigner amplitude inside
of the Dalitz tutorial.

v0.8 (17-Jun-15):

Fix a bug that appears on some platforms in newer versions of ROOT where the
user gets "missing dictionary" warnings and occassionally a segmentation
fault.

Modify all tutorials to remove dependence on CLHEP.

v0.6 (28-Jun-13):

Modify to make compatible with v0.6 of AmpTools.  This mainly involves more complete
utilization of the new FitResults class.

v0.5 (16-Nov-12):

First release that includes Tutorials.
