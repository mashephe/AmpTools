INSTALATION AND USE:

This package depends on CLHEP.  You should set the environment variable
CLHEP_INCLUDE_DIR to point to the CLHEP include directory, for example
/usr/local/CLHEP/include

This package also depends on ROOT.  Be sure that ROOTSYS points to your ROOT 
installation.

Typing 'make' will build the package and produce a single static library, 
libAmpTools.a, that can be linked by external packages.  To access the include 
files, it is recommended one add the path to this top level directory in the
-I flag to gcc.  Once this is done, files can be included in code by typing, 
for example, '#include "IUAmpTools/AmplitudeManager.h"'.

Support for computing amplitudes on graphics cards can be enabled by
typing 'make GPU=1'.  In this case CUDA_INSTALL_PATH should point to your
installation of CUDA and you may need to adjust the CUDA_FLAGS variable in 
the Makefile for your particular hardware.

Warning: MPI support is somewhat experimental at the moment.  You can build
MPI-enabled code by passing MPI=1 on the make command line


RELEASE NOTES:

v0.1 (2-January-2011):

First publicly available experimental version.  The package has been in
private testing for a long period of time.  Some aspects of the MPI implementation
still need refinement.  Callbacks to the amplitudes on a change of parameters
have not been enabled by the ParameterManagerMPI.  In addition, the MPI+GPU
features have not been tested.  For example, the code needs to learn how to
select the correct GPU on a multi-GPU fit.
