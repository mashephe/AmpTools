/**
 * A class for managing the construction of a sum of amplitudes.
 *
 * This class is used to construct the intensity for each event.
 * It manages multiple interfering amplitudes, each of which can be
 * composed of multiple amplitude factors.  It also maintains a link
 * to the production parameters (typically fit parameters) stored by
 * the parameter manager.
 *
 * Tyipcally the user will setup this class once at the start of some job
 * which could be either fitting data or generating Monte Carlo.  Once
 * the class is setup, then the const member functions can be called to
 * calculate intensities for blocks of events.
 *
 * There should be one instance of the MomentManager for each reaction or
 * set of unique final state particles in the fit.
