 *\defgroup IUAmpTools
 *
 * The IUAmpTools collection of classes provides an interface to formulate
 * an amplitude analysis.  It includes classes that perform several types of 
 * functions:
 *
 *  - defining amplitudes:  how one computes an amplitude for four vectors
 *  - defining intensities:  how one arranges coherent and incoherent sums
 * of amplitudes along with permutations of particles to describe an observable
 * distribution of events
 *  - defining the likelihood that is maximized by the fitter
 *  - managing the parameters in the fit
 *  - data I/O:  a mechanism for passing event data into the framework, and
 * also generating histograms from data
