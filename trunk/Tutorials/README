This directory contains a collection of Tutorials that utilize AmpTools and supporting
libraries.  Each directory contains the types of classes that a user might write to
do a physics analysis using AmpTools.  Check the doc subdirectory of each tutorial
for more information.

Dalitz
------

Author:  Ryan Mitchell (remitche@indiana.edu)

A simple example of a Dalitz plot analysis.  It illustrates generating MC and a toy
data set for fitting.  This example can also be compiled to use MPI and GPU acceleration.

gammaKK
-------

Author:  Kei Moriya (kmoriya@indiana.edu)

An example of vector meson radiative decays to gamma K K.  This example performs a fit
in bins of K K invariant mass.


RELEASE NOTES:

v0.8 (17-Jun-15):

Fix a bug that appears on some platforms in newer versions of ROOT where the
user gets "missing dictionary" warnings and occassionally a segmentation
fault.

Modify all tutorials to remove dependence on CLHEP.

v0.6 (28-Jun-13):

Modify to make compatible with v0.6 of AmpTools.  This mainly involves more complete
utilization of the new FitResults class.

v0.5 (16-Nov-12):

First release that includes Tutorials.
